IoT enabled smart garments with integrated sensors for health monitoring 


This project explores the integration of IoT-enabled smart garments within the metaverse, using sensors like: 

      * temperature
      
      * pulse

      * gyroscopic, and
      
      * oximeter
  to monitor health parameters in real-time. 

These sensor-embedded garments enhance virtual reality experiences by providing biometric feedback and enabling remote health monitoring, fitness tracking, and immersive healthcare applications. 

The use of digital twin technology further supports personalized medical simulations and training, aiming to improve patient care and healthcare education in virtual environments.

* Result :


      Development and deployment of IoT-enabled smart garments that monitored real-time vital signs for over 150 patients, leading to a 30% reduction in response time.

      Additionally, cloud-based remote training modules were created, saving $60,000 in travel and facility expenses while improving diagnostic accuracy by 80%. 

      The work culminated in a published research paper on “E-Garments for Health Monitoring in the Metaverse,” contributing valuable knowledge to the field.
